# DSAN-Problems_Vs_Algorithms
This project consists of a set of projects part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course at Udacity.

## Overview
The project consists of 7 problems on Data Structures:
1. Square Root of an Integer
2. Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
3. Rearrange Array Digits
4. Dutch National Flag Problem
5. Autocomplete with Tries
6. Unsorted Integer Array
7. Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

By use of previously learned data strucutres, these require implementation of several algorithms:
* Binary Search
* Tries
* Merge Sort (using Divide and Conquer)

The project also requires a time complexity analysis for each problem.

## How to run the project
The project contains 2 files for each problem:

The python code
An MD file containing a description of each implementation
There is also an MD containing the instructions.

Simply run python <file-name.py> to test the solution.

## Project Rubric
Correctness

Code produces the correct solution to the question. There are also no runtime or compile time errors.

Style

Code is neat and easy-to-read. Variables, functions, and methods have straightforward names. There is enough spacing that code is easily readable.

Simplicity

Code solution is not unnecessarily complex—it accomplishes the task at hand without extra iterating, algorithms, data structures, et cetera.

Testing

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Test Cases

At least three test inputs and outputs are provided. There are at least two that test for edge cases, like null or empty inputs, or very large numbers.

Explanation

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Efficiency

There is a clear and accurate statement of efficiency. There is an explanation that specifically mentions parts of the code that contribute to the overall efficiency.

Code Design

Explanation contains some discussion of design choices made in the code. Some examples include the choice of algorithm and data structure.

Readability

Explanation is written with proper English. Wording is clear and easy to understand. It’s okay to make a couple mistakes, but thoughts should be clearly expressed overall.
