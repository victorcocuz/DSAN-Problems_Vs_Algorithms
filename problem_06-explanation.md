# Problem 1 - Explanation
## Strategy
- Define a min and a max variable as the first value in the array
- Traverse the whole array. If any value is smaller than min or larger than max, attribute the new value correspondingly.
- Return min and max as a tuple
## Time and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: **O(n)** - A single array traverse
- Space Complexity: **O(1)** - The array is traversed in place
